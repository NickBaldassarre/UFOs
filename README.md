# An Analysis of UFO Sightings
## Overview
### JavaScript was written to filter data in a table based on user inputs in order to provide the ability to analyze UFO sightings. User inputs for date, city, state, country, and shape could be applied in any combination to filter the sightings.
## Results
The site is able to aid in the analysis of UFO sighting data by using input boxes to further filter the table. The first image below shows how a city input  of "el cajon" filters the table accordingly.

Pressing enter or selecting another input box applies the filter. A further filter can now be added, in this case, the shape "triangle".

Deleting the text in the input box resets the filters. Another example of the filters at work can be seen below:

![California January 4th](https://github.com/NickBaldassarre/UFOs/blob/ab28c9811162e54688a957cc4385dbc0b7189881/Resources/ca_1_4_2010.png)

Here, the table has been filtered to only include sightings that occured in California on January 4th, 2010.

## Summary

One major drawback of the site is that the input boxes are case sensitive. This is especially apparent if accessing the site from a device with auto capitalization enabled.

I recommend adding the ability to filter for keywords in the comments, such as "HOAX" and "NUFORC". I also recommend transforming the data in the duration column so that the ability to search based on duration can be effectively added. Finally, I recommend obtaining a much larger dataset in order to really utilize the analytical capabilities fo the site.
